So far, I have made a program that draws circles 1 pixel smaller and 1 rgb value less than the other on top of the previous circle, resulting in a cool effect. My program makes a gradient. I plan on converting my code into methods (because I didn't do that yet) and also adding some cool color effects. I also plan on making some other changes to make it look even cooler. I hope to finish this soon.

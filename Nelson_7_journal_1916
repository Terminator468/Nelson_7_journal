1. I haven't finished it (like everyone else), but I am making a game where you live in a house on a chain of islands and you lost the keys for your house so you have to find all of your keys before it gets too dark outside.
2. I figured out the problems with loading my map.
3. I finished most of my map, but I am still making many changes to it. I finished most of it before the break because I needed to get ahead.
4. No... too many problems... deadline too soon... so much pain...

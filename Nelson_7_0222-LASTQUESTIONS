1. I don't think that I am ready for this quiz quite yet, that, is, unless it's multiple choice
2. I really don't have any specific questions about the Slick game.
3. I would have to make multiple tiled maps (for levels), have some sort of drawing appear (the inventory), and add a score counter. The rest wouldn't really apply to my game.
4. I think that I am prepared to make this, but there are some things I will need help with.
5. I'm probably going to need help with the inventory, I know exactly how to make a score counter and multiple levels.

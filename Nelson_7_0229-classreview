1. This is how you create a class:
public class Something {

}
2. This is not a class constructor. This is because a class constructor is a method inside a class that allows you to set the variables of that class and it is how you create instances of that class. This only uses a class constructor to create an instance. 
3. public class Donut {
	int x, y;
	boolean isGlazed;
	boolean hasJelly;
	float temperature;
	public Donut(boolean a, boolean b, float c) {
		this.isGlazed = a;
		this.hasJelly = b;
		this.temperature = c;
	}
}
4. A getter gets. i.e., it returns a variable value. Usually, a getter is a public method to get a private value.
	public getHasJelly() {
		return this.hasJelly;
	}
	public void setTemperature(float c) {
		this.temperature = c;
	}
4. A getter is something that gets a value from a class somewhere else in the program.
5. A setter is something that sets a value in a class somewhere else in the program.
6. int[] coolnumberz; //this is an array of integers.
   String coolwordz; //this is an array of strings.
   boolean [] [] boolean; //this is a 2D array of booleans

1. Casting is when you take a specific variable of a specific data type and you convert it to another data type. Upcasting is when that variable becomes less specific (like a double to an int), and downcasting is when it becomes more specific (like an int to a double).
2. Code example for upcasting:
float a = 1;
int b = (int)a;
3. Code example for downcasting:
int a = 1;
float b = (float)a;
4. Code example for converting a char to a String:
char a = 'X';
String b = (String)a;
5. The range for a byte is -128 to 127.

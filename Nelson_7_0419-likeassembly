1. In assembly, you can use a jump function to jump to a specific section of code. And, you can make these jumps unconditional or conditional. This is EXACTLY like HRM in that you can jump to other lines of code, and it can be conditional or unconditional.
2. Some differences between Assembly and HRM is that in HRM you are limited to certain blocks of code that do specific things, but in Assembly, you can do much more, and it is much more configureable! Also, in HRM, you have a asthetically pleasing GUI. But, in Assembly, you have to make it all by hand with specific characters.

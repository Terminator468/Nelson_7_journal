1. ELF stands for Executeable and Linkable Format, so this compiles the code so that is is executable by the user.
2. LD is the compiler for the code.
3. Assembly does not use chmod because it already became executable after ELF.
4. This is the code I used:

global  _start

        section .text
_start:
        ; write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1                  ; system call 1 is write
        mov     rdi, 1                  ; file handle 1 is stdout
        mov     rsi, message            ; address of string to output
        mov     rdx, 43                 ; number of bytes
        syscall                         ; invoke operating system to do the wri$

        ; exit(0)
        mov     eax, 60                 ; system call 60 is exit
        xor     rdi, rdi                ; exit code 0
        syscall                         ; invoke operating system to exit
message:
        db      "My name is Simon, but you can call me Jude!", 50

5. I had to change the bit length so that it will print out the full sentence.
6. NO IT IS DEFINETELY NOT QUICK AND EASY! IT TOOK ME FOREVER JUST TO MAKE IT PRINT A FEW CHARACTERS!!!
7. It means that it is much more complicated but you can tell it exactly what you want to do. High level languages are much less code but most of the functions it uses are hidden.

1. An array is a group of some sort of data value that is of a certain length. There are 1D arrays, 2D arrays, and 3D arrays.
2. String[] stuff = new String[10];
3. It is written the same as a normal array, except that it has 2 pairs of brackets. Example: String[][] stuff = new String[10][10];
4. A 3D array is like a normal array except it has 3 pairs of brackets. Example: String[][][] stuff = new String[10][10][10];
5. stuff[3] = 3;
6. A while loop repeats a set code as long as a certain condition is true. To make a while loop, you need to put the condition in parentheses and type while before it, and then you put a pair of brackets after it and put whatever you want to repeat in that. Example: while (condition == true) { System.out.println("hi"); }
7. They help you do things like restart functions, repeating for a certain number of times, etc.
8. You will call the method like this: method(); . This will make the method run.
9. This is because the user could input an uppercase character that the program doesn't recognize, which would break the program.
10. This is so that you can organise your code much better, and you can call a method from anywhere in the program, so it is much more useful overall.
11. I will create values for health, location, etc. To make it accessible by other methods I will make these values static. This is so that I can access the variables from any method.

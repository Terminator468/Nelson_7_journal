1. A class constructor is where you define a class in a Java program.
2. It should include these things:
        private int x;
	private int y;
	private boolean isvisible = true;
	Image orb;
	public Orb(int x, int y) throws SlickException {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
		this.isvisible = false;
	}
3. It should have this method:
	public Orb(int x, int y) throws SlickException {
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
		this.isvisible = false;
	}

1. I created a game where you explore an island and you try to find 4 keys before it gets dark outside.
2. I had a lot of problems with loading my map, making the blocks blocked, and configuring the hitbox.
3. I finished most of my map before the break. I did this because I really needed to get ahead and I did not want to be behind.
4. I wasn't quite able to meet the deadline because of all of the problems I had with my game.
